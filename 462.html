<h3>With everything good, comes something bad. With something bad, there's always good. Just like with AI. Some good stuff is, you can play games with it, you can chat with it. In fact, there's even a game where you have to try and spot whether you're talking to a human, or an AI. However, on the flip side of things, AI can be used to cheat on tests. AI also has voice copying meaning it can replicate voices and you may be wondering, isn't that good? The simple answer is no. Simply no. Let's say your bank account password is voice recognized, then someone could get you saying just a few words on audio. Then an AI could almost perfectly replicate that voice, and all that money you've been saving towards a Lamborghini is gone. Just gone because of a simple computer program. But not all is baad with AI. some might say there are more pros than cons. Some of which might be, when you're struggling with your math homework and you or your parents don't know. Ask AI. Don't know what to get your parents for Christmas. You can ask AI. There's an infinite amount of possibilities. You just need to find them.</h3>
